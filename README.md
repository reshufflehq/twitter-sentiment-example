This is a [Reshuffle](https://reshuffle.com/) template.

## About

This is an example of running sentiment analysis on Tweets. This example uses the Twitter API to extract the latest tweets of a given handle, and runs several toxicity and sentiment analysis algorithms over it (Googleâ€™s sentiment analysis, a popular Node package, and Perspective API). Please remix to create your own sentiment analysis app for Facebook for example, or using the Azure sentiment analysis for example.
